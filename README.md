In the beginning all players get two cards. After this all of them could get extra cards in turn. If a player take more or equal to 21 score, his turn is over. When the last one ended their turn - dealer makes the move. The rule is simple - dealer have to get cards if the score less than 17. After the dealer's turn - checks the score of all players and if the score is equal or less than dealer's - you lose. Except the case when dealer gets more than 21 - in this situation all players in the game win.
